# Hello, World!

Hi, I'm Simha. I'm a systems programming enthusiast. I love to play with rust-lang. I'm still a long away from being a master, I intend to achieve a certain level of mastery in a time frame of a year. All the efforts I'm putting in this direction shall be blogged here. Hope my code is not as boring as this introduction. 

Thank you :)
