On 8th of October 2019,

I completed the rustlings course with no difficulty. It was a good primer for a rust language beginner. I wish there were a rustlings-II, with a lot more challenging quests. But for that, I may as well practice on leetcode or hackerrank - which I'm already doing. There are still some aspects that are a bit confusing when I get down to implementation. When do I use the interior mutability pattern - `Rc<RefCell<T>>` ? what about `Box dyn Trait` types...
